# CTA Tracker

## What is it?
CTA Tracker is a CLI Application that lets the user search for any train or bus station in Chicago and provides up to five arrival times at that station. It also lets the user save their favorite stations for ease of access.

## How to use it
The user first logs in by entering their username. This will take them to the main menu. From here, the user can either look at their favorite stations or they can search for any station by name or id. The user can then save or remove that station from their favorites.
CTA Tracker provides an easy navigation flow for the user through its use of commands.
